## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Will AI replace software developers?
  **My answer:** AI will not replace coders but coders who use AI will replace those who don't use AI.

**Chatgpt:** AI is unlikely to completely replace software developers. Instead, it will transform the way they work by automating repetitive tasks, generating boilerplate code, and helping with debugging. Developers will continue to be essential for:
Complex problem-solving: AI can't fully understand business requirements or design innovative solutions.
Human creativity and judgment: Developing software often involves trade-offs and decisions that require a deep understanding of the problem and context.
Ethical considerations: Developers guide AI in making ethical choices and avoiding harmful outcomes.
AI tools can enhance productivity and help developers focus on higher-level design and logic, but software development will still need skilled professionals.

**Observation:** My answer is more concise while the answer provided by chatgpt is more detailed. It focuses on the how and why.

- What is the best way to use AI tools when learning software development?
  **My answer:** When learning software development, the best way to use AI is to ask questions related to syntax, error messages, to explain code or concepts.

**Chatgpt:**
As a supplementary resource: Use AI to clarify concepts, generate examples, or debug your code, but ensure you also understand the underlying principles.
Practice active learning: If you ask AI to generate code, take the time to study it, experiment, and understand why it works.
Break down problems: Use AI for suggestions when you're stuck, but first try solving the problem on your own.
Debugging assistant: AI can help identify errors and suggest fixes, which is especially useful when learning how to debug.
Learning new concepts: AI can provide accessible explanations or walk you through how to use a new library or framework.

**Observation:** The answer provided by AI seem relevant to someone who has more experience coding. For a beginner, these ways can prove to be detrimental.

- What is the danger of using AI tools for software development while I'm still learning?
  **My answer:** The danger of using AI while I'm still learning is that I may become too dependant on AI and I may not learn effectively. I will also not know if the solution provided is correct.

**Chatgpt:**
Over-reliance: If you depend too much on AI, you might not develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for coding.
Superficial understanding: Copy-pasting AI-generated solutions without understanding them can lead to gaps in knowledge.
Learning bad practices: AI tools may occasionally generate inefficient or suboptimal code, which could reinforce bad habits.
Limited creativity: Relying on AI might discourage you from experimenting and coming up with your own innovative solutions.
Ethical blind spots: AI can sometimes produce biased or insecure code. Without a strong foundation, you might not recognize these issues.

**Observation:** Both the answers talk about over-reliance as a danger of using AI while still learning. The answer provided by chatgpt also focuses about the long term effects while mine talks based on the present situation.
