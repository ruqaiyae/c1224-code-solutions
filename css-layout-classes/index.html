              <p>
                Super Smash Bros. Ultimate received universal acclaim from both
                critics and players, with some critics calling it the best
                installment in the series. It received praise for its large
                amount of content and fine-tuning of existing Smash gameplay
                elements, although its online mode was widely criticized.

              <p>
                Donkey Kong is a series of video games featuring the adventures
                of a gorilla called Donkey Kong, conceived by Shigeru Miyamoto
                in 1981. The franchise consists mainly of two game genres, but
                also includes additional spin-off titles of various genres.
              </p>
              <p>
                The games of the first genre are mostly single-screen
                platform/action puzzle types, featuring Donkey Kong as the
                opponent in an industrial construction setting.
