- What data type do comparison expressions evaluate to?
  Boolean

- What is the purpose of an `if` statement?
  It is used to check if a required condition is met, if it is then the rest of the code gets executed.

- Is `else` required in order to use an `if` statement?
  No, it is only required to handle the opposite condition.

- Describe the syntax (structure) of an `if` statement.
  'if' keyword followed by a condition in parenthesis followed by a block of code in curly braces that will be executed if the condition will be evaluated to true.

- What are the three logical operators?
  Logical AND (&&)
  Logical OR (||)
  Logical NOT (!)

- How do you compare two different expressions in the same condition?
  With a logical operator

- What is the purpose of a `switch` statement?
  It checks multiple conditions like an if-else statement, but the switch statement makes it a bit more readable and user-friendly.

- Is a `default` clause required in order to use a `switch` statement?
  A default clause is optional. It can technically be omitted, but it's a nice way to handle a final catch all in case any previous clauses did not execute.
