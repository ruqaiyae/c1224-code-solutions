## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:cd

- Briefly describe the List data structure.
  A list is a data structure that holds its data in a contiguous block of memory. Each element in a list is the same size, and they are accessed by index, with the first element being at index 0. It allows for insertion, deletion, and retrieval of elements at specific positions.

- What are some examples of when you would use a List?

- How do you read an element of a List given its index? What is its time complexity?
  We read an element of a List given its index with bracket notation. Its time complexity is O(1) (constant time).

- How do you add an element into a List at a given index? What is its time complexity?
  We add an element into a List at a given index with the splice method. Its time complexity is O(n) (linear time).

- How do you update an element in a List at a given index? What is its time complexity?
  We update an element into a List at a given index with the splice method. Its time complexity is O(n) (linear time).

- How do you remove an element from a List at a given index? What is its time complexity?
  We remove an element into a List at a given index with the splice method. Its time complexity is O(n) (linear time).
