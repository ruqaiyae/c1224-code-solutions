## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of variables?
  Variables act as containers for storing data values.

- How do you **declare** a variable?
  Using var, let, or const

- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?
  The = symbol is used as the assignment operator in TypeScript. It assigns the value on its right to the variable on its left.

- What characters are allowed in variable names?
  Characters can include letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, but must start with a letter, $, or \_.

- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?
  Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that capitalization matters. Two variables with the same name, but with different capitalization, are treated as 2 separate variables.

- What is the purpose of a string?
  A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text.

- What is the purpose of a number?
  Number is used to represent both integer and floating-point values.

- What is the purpose of a boolean?
  Booleans in TypeScript represent one of two values: true or false. They are typically used in conditional testing where you need to decide which path of code to execute based on the truthiness of a condition.

- What does the `=` operator mean in JavaScript?
  The = symbol is used as the assignment operator in TypeScript. It assigns the value on its right to the variable on its left.

- How do you update the value of a variable?
  The variable needs to be defined using the 'let' keyword. To update the value we simply write the name of the variable followed by the '=' symbol followed by the new value.

- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
  'undefined' typically indicates that a variable has not been initialized, while 'null' is used to intentionally denote the absence of any value.

- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?
  A console log "label" is simply a short string that describes the variable or value being logged. When logging multiple values to the console, labels help identify the values being logged.

- Give five examples of JavaScript primitives.
  String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null
