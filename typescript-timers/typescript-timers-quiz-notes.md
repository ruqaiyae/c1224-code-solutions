## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a "callback" function?
  A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after its parent function has completed. Callbacks are often used in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations, such as waiting for a file to load or a timer to complete.

- Besides adding an event listener callback function to an element or the `document`, what is one way to delay the execution of a JavaScript function until some point in the future?
  With the setTimeout Method

- How can you set up a function to be called repeatedly without using a loop?
  With the setInterval Method

- What is the default time delay if you omit the `delay` parameter from `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()`?
  0 milliseconds

- What do `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` return?
  This method returns an interval ID which uniquely identifies the interval, so you can remove it later by calling clearInterval().
