## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are objects used for?
  To group related data and functions together that can be reused throughout the code.

- What are object properties?
  A property is a “key: value” pair, where key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.

- Describe object literal notation.
  We use curly braces with an optional list of properties.

- How do you remove a property from an object?
  We use the 'delete' operator.

- What are the two ways to get or update the value of a property?
  To get or update the value of a property, we use the dot notation or the square brackets.

- What is the purpose of interfaces in TypeScript?
  Interfaces allow us to define the shape of objects in Typescript.

- What are two different ways to describe the shape of an object in TypeScript?
  The two different ways are 'interface' and 'type'.

- How do optional properties in a TypeScript interface differ from mandatory properties, and why are they useful?
  Some properties may or may not be set when creating an object. So to avoid errors we set optional properties in the Typescript interface. Optional properties allow us to add or delete properties without getting any error messages.
