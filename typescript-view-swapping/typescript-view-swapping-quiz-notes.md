## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the `event.target`?
  It refers to the element that is responsible for firing the event.

- What is the effect of setting an element to `display: none`?
  Setting an element to `display: none` hides it

- What does the `element.matches()` method take as an argument and what does it return?
  It takes an element or tag name and returns a boolean value

  With the getAttribute method

- At what steps of the solution would it be helpful to log things to the console?
  Every step or every few steps at least

- If you were to add another tab and view to your HTML, but you didn't use event delegation, how would your TypeScript code be written instead?
  Every tab would have it's own separate event listener.

- If you didn't use a loop to conditionally show or hide the views in the page, how would your TypeScript code be written instead?
  We would have to access each element from the nodeList by its index and write a conditional statement for each element.
