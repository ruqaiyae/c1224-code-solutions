## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function is a reusable block of code.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  The parts of a function definition include:
  *The function keyword to begin the creation of a new function.
  *An optional name.
  *A comma-separated list of zero or more parameters, surrounded by () parentheses.
  *The start of the function's code block, as indicated by an { opening curly brace.
  *An optional return statement.
  *The end of the function's code block, as indicated by a } closing curly brace.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  The function's name followed by a comma-separated list of zero or more arguments surrounded by () parentheses.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  Function definition means creating a function or a block of code that either returns a value or simply 'does something'. While a function call means executing the function (it runs the block of code that was written in the function definition).

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  When we define a function, we declare parameters and that when we call a function, we pass it arguments.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Because they allow functions to accept inputs, making them flexible and reusable for different values instead of hardcoding specific data.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  Causes the function to produce a value we can use in our program.
  Prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run.

- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  An arrow [=>] is used between the parameter list and code block.

- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  Arrow functions have an implicit return when curly braces {} are not used to contain the function's code block.
