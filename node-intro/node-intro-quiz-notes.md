## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the 3 components of a fullstack Web architecture?
  The frontend that the user interacts with (Web site or Mobile app)
  The backend server that takes requests from the frontend and processes them
  The database where data is stored and used across all instances of the frontend

- What is Node.js and why is it useful?
  Node.js is a program that allows JavaScript to be run outside of a web browser. It is used to build backend servers for Web applications.

- What are environment variables and how do you access them in Node.js?
  Environment variables are key-value pairs that store configuration settings for an application, such as database credentials. They allow the application to adapt to different environments (development, testing, production) without changing the source code.
  They are accessed using process.env.

- What is a REPL?
  A read–eval–print loop (REPL) is a simple interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs, executes them, and returns the result to the user; a program written in a REPL environment is executed piecewise.
  It is useful for:
  Testing small pieces of code quickly.
  Debugging and fixing errors.
