## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a client?
  Client is a computer that gets information from another computer called server in the context of clientâ€“server model of computer networks. The server is often (but not always) on another computer system, in which case the client accesses the service by way of a network.

- What is a server?
  A server is a computer that provides information to other computers called "clients" on a computer network.

- Which HTTP method does a browser issue to a web server when you visit a URL?
  GET method

- What is on the first line of an HTTP **request** message?
  The first line is called a "request-line" and is made of three parts:
  <method> <request-target> <protocol>
  -- Method is one of a set of defined words that describes the meaning of the request and the desired outcome. For example, GET indicates that the client would like to receive a resource in return, and POST means that the client is sending data to a server.
  -- Request target is usually an absolute or relative URL
  -- Protocol refers to the HTTP version used in the communication between the client and the server. The HTTP version defines the structure of the remaining message.

- What is on the first line of an HTTP **response** message?
  The first line is called a "status line" in responses, and has three parts:
  <protocol> <status-code> <status-text>
  -- Protocol is the HTTP version of the remaining message.
  -- Status code is a numeric value that indicates whether the request succeeded or failed. Common status codes are 200(successful), 404(not found), or 302(redirection).
  -- The status text is a brief, purely informational, textual description of the status code to help a human understand the HTTP message.

- What are HTTP headers?
  HTTP headers contain metadata that describes the message. For example, a request for a resource might include the allowed formats of that resource, while the response might include headers to indicate the actual format returned.

- Is a body required for a valid HTTP message?
  Responses with a status code that answers the request without the need to include message content, such as 201 Created or 204 No Content, do not have a body.
