            Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across
            clinicians, staft, and patients themselves — making you more
            productive, less stressed, and adding just a bit more joy into your
            practice of medicine.

          You don't have to click a dozen times to order a flu shot or bounce
          around five windows to discover the last blood count. Canvas pulls
          everything you need directly into your note, so you never have to
          leave it. And because Canvas learns from every interaction, it gets
          smarter with every patient you see.

          information is presented in the right wav of the right time, and the
          product leverages technology to actually improve the quality of care I
          provide.”

          Canvas makes it simple to search and take action across your entire

          proactive interventions, and take comfort knowing you're a step ahead.

          seem like a lot to ask and those are tremendously important questions.
          But I just couldn't get an answer from our old system! Canvas is

          Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you understand
          performance, but they aren't enough to improve quality and increase
          revenue day after day. Canvas automates quality protocols and charge
          capture so clinicians can focus on more complex work only they can do.

          We&apos;re a small practice and we don't have a big quality team or a
