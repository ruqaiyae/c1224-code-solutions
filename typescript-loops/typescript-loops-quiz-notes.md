## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  Loops allow us to execute the block of code repeatedly.

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  conditional expressions are used to indicate when the loop should terminate, and stop iterating. The loop will continue to run as long as the conditional expression evaluates to true.

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  A single execution of the loop body is called an iteration

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  It gets evaluated before the each iteration of the while loop.

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The initial expression only runs once before the loop begins to iterate

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The conditional expression runs before each iteration of the loop, so that our code knows whether to continue or terminate the loop.

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The final expression gets evaluated after each iteration. Once the code inside the loops code block finishes, the final expression will kick in, and then move to the conditional expression.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  'break' statement

- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  The increment (++) operator increments (adds one to) its operand and returns the value before or after the increment, depending on where the operator is placed.

- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  With the for...in loop.
